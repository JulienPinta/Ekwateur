# Launch

## How to start the project

You can either try to open the project with IntelliJ and run the main method in BillComputer.

You can also build the project and make a jar and then execute it.

By default, you'll find in the resources a .jar file with a some computation of bills.
You can start it from a terminal (being in the root folder) doing
```
java -jar src/main/resources/ekwateur.jar
```

## TIME

I took approximatively 75 minutes.
